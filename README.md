# Fake Logo Detection
This project focuses on detecting fake logos using machine learning techniques. The implementation is done using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately identify fake logos. The model is trained on a dataset of images containing both real and fake logos.

## Files in the Repository
- `Logo_Detection.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for loading data, preprocessing, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
